  "readme": "#DynamicCache\n\nA middleware layer for [ServiceWorkerWare](https://github.com/arcturus/serviceworkerware/) that will allow you to modify the content of a cache.\n\n## Usage\n\nIn your ServiceWorker code:\n\n```\nimportScripts('./sww.js');\nimportScripts('./dynamiccache.js');\n\nvar worker = new self.ServiceWorkerWare();\nworker.use(new DynamicCache('dynamic'));\n\nworker.init();\n```\n\nYou create a new `DynamicCache` object, and pass a string, representing the name of the cache that this worker will be handling.\n\n\n## API\n\nYou'll find the following methods:\n\n+ `list`: get a full list of all url handled by this middleware.\n+ `post`: add or modify the content on the cache. Will receive a json object to specify the content:\n++ `content`: object (or string), representing the content.\n++ `url`: string, the url to be cached.\n++ `headers`: (optional), object containing the headers (like 'Content-Type') that will be send with your response object.\n\nWhy there is no `get` method? The middleware will be returning the content during the `onFetch` phase, so any HTTP request will give you the content.\n\n\n## Modifying the content\nAll this functions are available if you execute them in the ServiceWorker scope. So you can call the previous methods to perform actions.\nBut this middleware allows you to modify the content through any client that has access to the worker. The communication is done via\n`postMessage` (or [BroadcastChannel API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Broadcast_Channel_API) if available) with an specific protocol.\n\n\nIn order to make this easier you can use the [DynamicCacheClient](https://github.com/arcturus/dynamiccacheclient), a simple javascript library that you can use from a window, Worker or Sharedworker.\n\n\n\n\n",
